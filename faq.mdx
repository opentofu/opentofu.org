<AccordionItem id="what-is-opentofu" summary="What is OpenTofu?" open highlight>

OpenTofu is a software platform built to address _Infrastructure as Code_ (IaC), _Monitoring as Code_ (MaC), and _Security as Code_ (SaC) challenges.

You can define both cloud-based and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, audit, reuse, and share. You have a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. OpenTofu can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

Having started life as a fork of [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) v1.5, it has _exceptional_ compatibility with the existing ecosystem of Terraform providers and modules. The project is open-source and community-driven, meaning that no single company can dictate its direction.

The _Technical Steering Committee_ (TSC) is responsible for the project’s direction, and is hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org). Current TSC members include [Gruntwork](https://www.gruntwork.io), [Spacelift](https://spacelift.io), [Harness](https://www.harness.io), [Env0](https://www.env0.com), [Scalr](https://www.scalr.com), and others. The [initiative has many supporters](/supporters).

<AccordionItem id="why-was-opentofu-created" summary="Why was OpenTofu created?" highlight>

OpenTofu was created in response to HashiCorp’s switch from an open-source license to the [Business Source License](https://spdx.org/licenses/BUSL-1.1.html) (BUSL). We believe that the BUSL and the additional-use grant outlined by HashiCorp are ambiguous, which makes it challenging for companies, vendors, and developers using Terraform to determine whether or not their actions could be interpreted as being outside the permitted scope of use.

[Hashicorp’s Licensing FAQ](https://www.hashicorp.com/license-faq) give some peace-of-mind to end users and system integrators for now, but the implications for future usage are unclear. The possibility that HashiCorp’s definition of “competitive” or “embedding” could change, or that the license could be further modified to restrict use prompts uncertainty for Terraform users.

We believe that this ecosystem should remain open-source because it is a project many companies use, and many contributors have made Terraform what it is today. Terraform’s success would not have been possible without the community’s work to build many supporting projects around it.

<AccordionItem id="opentofu-terraform-differences" summary="What are the differences between OpenTofu and Terraform?" highlight>

On the technical level, OpenTofu 1.6.x is very similar feature-wise to Terraform 1.6.x. In the future, the feature sets will diverge. OpenTofu will have features not found in Terraform, and vice versa. As a matter of fact, this is already beginning to happen.

The other primary difference is that OpenTofu is available under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/MPL-2.0.html) (MPL-2.0), an [open-source license](https://opensource.org/licenses?ls=MPL-2.0) ([definition](https://opensource.org/osd)). Its goal is to be driven collaboratively by the community, with no single company being able to dictate the roadmap.

If there are features that you would like to see in OpenTofu, please open an issue on the [OpenTofu GitHub repository](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues).

<AccordionItem id="why-use-opentofu" summary="Why should you use OpenTofu instead of Terraform?" highlight>

#### Personal use

Initial impressions suggest you could use either OpenTofu or Terraform for personal use, as the [Business Source License](https://spdx.org/licenses/BUSL-1.1.html) (BUSL) has no restrictions for non-commercial use cases. That may change as the Terraform ecosystem becomes increasingly unstable, and a switch to another license may happen. Those familiar with Terraform should have very issues adopting OpenTofu for personal use, as long as they are not using features that are _exclusive_ to Terraform.

#### Consultants

A consultant should offer their clients the best possible solution that aligns with their budget. OpenTofu will be on par with Terraform, and one of the project’s central objectives is to listen to the community’s issues, so it makes sense to recommend a project that will always remain open-source. The large community involved in developing OpenTofu means that issues will be triaged, scheduled, and implemented in a timely manner.

#### Companies

Companies _may_ encounter more difficulties with the situation. Switching to a new project carries risks, but staying with a project that changes its license without warning is far riskier. This risk is minimized by granting OpenTofu to the Linux Foundation, and OpenTofu’s aim of maintaining feature parity with Terraform for future releases reduces the technical risks.

<AccordionItem id="opentofu-compatibility" summary="Will OpenTofu be compatible with future Terraform releases?" highlight>

OpenTofu will remain compatible with Terraform versions 1.5.x and most of 1.6.x.

Core functionality with regard to the Terraform HCL language will remain compatible with future Terraform releases. OpenTofu remains compatible with the underlying gRPC-based [Provider Protocol](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/how-terraform-works) upon which all current providers are built.

Outside of those areas, the community will decide which features OpenTofu will have. In some cases, we've already shipped features in OpenTofu that spent years languishing in the Terraform backlog. There are even features which are exclusive to OpenTofu, such as [State and Plan Encryption](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/state/encryption/), and even writing custom provider functions in [Go](https://github.com/opentofu/terraform-provider-go) or [Lua](https://github.com/opentofu/terraform-provider-lua).

If there are features that you would like to see in OpenTofu, please open an issue on the [OpenTofu GitHub repository](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues).

<AccordionItem id="terraform-replacement" summary="Can I use OpenTofu as a drop-in replacement for Terraform?  Is OpenTofu suitable for production use?" highlight>

OpenTofu will remain compatible with Terraform versions 1.5.x and most of 1.6.x. In these cases, it is a drop-in replacement for Terraform. You don’t need to make any changes to your code to ensure compatibility.

OpenTofu is suitable for production use cases without any exception. Please see [our migration guide](/docs/intro/migration) for more information.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem id="state-file" summary="Will OpenTofu work with my existing state file?">

OpenTofu will work with existing state files up to those created with Terraform versions 1.5.x.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem id="providers" summary="Does OpenTofu work with all the providers Terraform works with?">

The [Terraform Plugin SDK v2](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk) and the newer [Terraform Plugin Framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework) are both available under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/MPL-2.0.html) (MPL-2.0), an [open-source license](https://opensource.org/licenses?ls=MPL-2.0) ([definition](https://opensource.org/osd)). This means that we can continue leveraging the existing providers and modules in OpenTofu without having to fork them.

Terraform providers have not altered their licenses, and the potential for such a change is virtually zero. OpenTofu works with the current Terraform providers, but it uses a [separate registry](https://search.opentofu.org). If those circumstances change, we will have to adapt. But we are confident that the OpenTofu and its community will be able to resolve any issues that arise.
