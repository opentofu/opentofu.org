Hey there, OpenTofu community! We've been working hard to refine the [1.8.0-alpha1](/blog/help-us-test-opentofu-1-8-0-alpha1/) with your feedback! A few rough edges have been polished and a few new features have been added.

If you have a **non-production** setup that you would be willing to test any of the new features on, please give it a try and give us [feedback using a GitHub issue](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/new/choose), even if it's just telling us that everything went well.

This blog post will go over how to download the new preview release and expand on the features presented in the [1.8.0-alpha1 blog post](/blog/help-us-test-opentofu-1-8-0-alpha1/).

:::warning

Do not test this release on a production project! It is not a stable release!

## Provider mocking in `tofu test`

Building on the existing ability to override specific data sources, resources, and module calls, `tofu test` now supports mocking entire provider definitions. This new feature allows you to automatically generate mock values for resources and data sources on a per-provider basis. As an example, consider the following code that spins up an m6i.2xlarge instance on AWS:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
    most_recent = true
    filter {
      name   = "name"
      values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-24.04-amd64-server-*"]
    }
    owners = ["099720109477"]
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
    instance_type = "m6i.2xlarge"
}
```

Instead of querying the AMI ID and spinning up the instance, we can write test code as follows:
```hcl
// This block will prevent OpenTofu from configuring aws provider.
// All provider's resources and data sources will be mocked.
mock_provider "aws" {
  mock_data "aws_ami" {
    defaults = {
      id = "ami-12345"
    }
  }
}

run "test" {
  assert {
    condition     = aws_instance.web.ami == "ami-12345"
    error_message = "Incorrect AMI ID passed to aws_instance.web: ${aws_instance.web.ami}"
  }
}
```

While this will not fully test the entire provisioning, it will highlight errors that may be caused by incorrectly connecting resources together without the need for an actual AWS account.

## Resource overrides in `tofu test`

First introduced in OpenTofu 1.8.0-alpha1, you can now override resources, data sources and entire modules from your tests, allowing you to create similar behavior to mocks in traditional software testing. As an example, consider the following code that spins up an `m6i.2xlarge` instance on AWS:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
    most_recent = true
    filter {
      name   = "name"
      values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-24.04-amd64-server-*"]
    }
    owners = ["099720109477"]
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
    instance_type = "m6i.2xlarge"
}
```

Instead of querying the AMI ID and spinning up the instance, we can write test code as follows:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "foo"
  secret_key = "bar"

  skip_credentials_validation = true
  skip_region_validation      = true
  skip_metadata_api_check     = true
  skip_requesting_account_id  = true
}

# This block disables refreshing the aws_ami.ubuntu data source
# and lets you manually specify the values:
override_data {
  target = data.aws_ami.ubuntu
  values = {
    id = "ami-12345"
  }
}

run "test" {
  # This block disables provisioning the aws_instance.web resource:
  override_resource {
    target = aws_instance.web
    values = {
      # You can add values here.
    }
  }

  assert {
    condition     = aws_instance.web.ami == "ami-12345"
    error_message = "Incorrect AMI ID passed to aws_instance.web: ${aws_instance.web.ami}"
  }
}
```

While this will not fully test the entire provisioning, it will highlight errors that may be caused by incorrectly connecting resources together without the need for an actual AWS account. Similarly, you can use `override_module` to override an entire module.

## Early variable/locals evaluation

Introduced in OpenTofu 1.8.0-alpha1, this feature lets you use variables and locals for **backends**, **module sources** and **encryption configuration** as long as they are not dependent on resources, data sources or module outputs. This works even if a local is referencing a variable, for example. This is only the first in a series of improvements that will make the .tf code more flexible with more improvements coming in future releases.

The `tofu init` command will now consume your `.tfvars` file and let you specify variables using the `-var` and `-var-file` options. Please note that this alpha release will *not* prompt you for missing variables, which is a feature we will add later. Note, that `tofu init` will fail if it is missing variables needed for static evaluation.

For example, if you wanted to use the same configuration for your S3 backend and your AWS provider, you can now do this:

```hcl
variable "aws_region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    region = var.aws_region
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}
```

You can also use this to manage module versions with both registry references and git URLs.

```hcl
locals {
  aws_module_version = "5.6.1"
}

module "ec2_instance" "webserver" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws"
  version = local.aws_module_version

  // Other ec2_instance options
}

module "ec2_instance" "db" {
  source  = "https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ec2-instance?ref=v${local.aws_module_version}"

  // Other ec2_instance options
}
```

Finally, here's how you can set up encryption with a passphrase using a variable:

```hcl
variable "passphrase" {
  type = string
}

terraform {
  encryption {
    key_provider "pbkdf2" "my_passphrase" {
      passphrase = var.passphrase
    }

    method "aes_gcm" "my_method" {
      keys = key_provider.pbkdf2.my_passphrase
    }

    state {
      method = method.aes_gcm.my_method
    }
  }
}
```

## Override files for OpenTofu: keeping compatibility

Since we are now adding features to OpenTofu that are not present in Terraform, we want to give module authors the ability to write code for both OpenTofu and Terraform without needing to maintain two copies of their modules. You can now create files named `.tofu` that are exclusive to OpenTofu. If you create a file named `foo.tofu`, OpenTofu will ignore the similarly-named `foo.tf` file. You can use this functionality to put your Terraform-specific code in the `.tf` file and then override it for OpenTofu in the `.tofu` file.

## Bugfixes and improvements

### Static Variable Planing

Static variables are now handled correctly when embedded in plan files. This was [reported as a bug](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1768) found in 1.8.0-alpha1.
```bash
tofu plan -out=tofu.tfstate -var="param=value"
# Variables are correctly read from the given plan and should not be specified via CLI
tofu show tofu.tfstate
tofu apply tofu.tfstate
```

### Improved provider error messages

Also included in the beta is [improvements in error messages produced by misconfigured providers](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1484). Some defaulted providers which require configuration blocks were able to generate error messages like:

```
╷
│ Error: Insufficient features blocks
│ 
│   on <empty> line 0:
│   (source code not available)
│ 
│ At least 1 "features" blocks are required.
╵
```

This error message will now include information about which provider is encountering the specific missing-block validation issue to help the user track it down.
