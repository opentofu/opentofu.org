We're thrilled to announce the release of OpenTofu 1.10.0, our most comprehensive update yet! This release represents months of dedicated work from our community, introducing some fantastic features that will improve how OpenTofu users manage and distribute infrastructure as code.

From OCI registry support that revolutionizes provider and module distribution, to deprecation support that helps module authors gracefully evolve their APIs, OpenTofu 1.10.0 is packed with enhancements that address real-world challenges faced by teams at scale. We're incredibly grateful to everyone who tested our alpha and beta releases, provided feedback, and contributed code – your input has been invaluable in shaping this release.

## The Perfect 10: Celebrating 10 Million Downloads

As we release OpenTofu 1.10.0, we're thrilled to announce that we're about to cross an incredible milestone: **10 million downloads** from GitHub releases alone! Currently at 9.8 million downloads, we're on track to hit this landmark within days. This doesn't even include installations from Homebrew, package managers, Docker Hub, or corporate mirrors – the true number is likely already well past 20 million.

Perhaps most impressively, our community's trust is evident in adoption velocity. If we look at the GitHub release downloads, when we released v1.9.1, it overtook v1.9.0 in just **7 days** – the fastest patch adoption we've ever seen. Currently, 63% of the total downloads daily are for the latest v1.9.x series.

## Major Features Overview

OpenTofu 1.10.0 is packed with powerful new capabilities that address real-world infrastructure challenges. Here are the highlights:

- **OCI Registry Support** - Distribute providers and modules through container registries, perfect for air-gapped environments
- **Native S3 State Locking** - Simplified state management without requiring DynamoDB
- **Deprecation Support** - Module authors can now mark variables and outputs as deprecated
- **Enhanced Planning** - New `-target-file` and `-exclude-file` options for better resource management
- **Global Provider Cache Lock** - Safe concurrent operations in CI/CD environments
- **OpenTelemetry Tracing** - Local-only observability for debugging and performance analysis
- **External Key Providers** - Flexible state encryption with your preferred secret management tools
- **Enhanced moved and removed blocks** - More powerful infrastructure refactoring capabilities
