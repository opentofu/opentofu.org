Today marks the one-year anniversary of the [1.6 release](/blog/opentofu-is-going-ga/) and we are proud to announce the immediate availability of [OpenTofu 1.9.0](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/releases/tag/v1.9.0) with a number of features the community has been requesting for some time. Chief among them provider `for_each` allowing for easier multi-zone or multi-region deployments. In detail, this release brings:

- Provider iteration (`for_each`)
- The `-exclude` flag
- Improvements to early evaluation, encryption, AzureRM and HTTP backends
- Several new CLI options
- Significant performance improvements

You can find the full list of improvements and changes on the [What's new in OpenTofu 1.9?](/docs/intro/whats-new/) page.

In line with our support policy, this release also means that OpenTofu 1.6 is no longer supported and we will not release security updates for it anymore. If you are still using 1.6, please upgrade to at least 1.7.

## Massive growth: ~300% increase in registry traffic, rising download numbers

Yes, you read that right. While our previous release showed [an increase of roughly 30% over a period of 4 months](/blog/opentofu-1-8-0), in the current release the amount of registry requests have tripled to over 6 million requests per day, peaking at a data transfer of over 140 GB per day.

Similarly, the number of GitHub downloads has risen significantly by about 30% in the 1.8 release to almost 1.5 million downloads. Interestingly, we had over 5000 downloads on the 1.9 prerelease versions.

Apart from users, we also have a very active community helping out with reporting issues, fixing bugs, and helping newcomers with questions. The number of GitHub stars grew to over 23.000, we have received over 150 new issues and the community has been [actively voting on them](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1496). For this release, our community has contributed over 200 pull requests with features and bugfixes from 49 contributors on the main repository alone.

## OpenTofu Search (beta)

Since our last release, we have indexed the documentation of over 4.000 providers and over 20.000 modules in the [OpenTofu Search](https://search.opentofu.org) interface. This was a monumental effort producing over 146 GB of raw data and the project updates the documentation for new provider and module versions every 15-30 minutes. Thanks to the generous sponsorship by Cloudflare, our costs for maintaining this infrastructure are minimal. It took over 12.000 lines of combined Go and Typescript code to accomplish.

## Jetbrains and VS Code IDE support

In their 2024.3 release, [Jetbrains has announced support for OpenTofu](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/2024-3/). The integration switches to OpenTofu when it detects a `.tofu` file in a project and provides OpenTofu-specific code completion, such as state encryption.

In parallel, the OpenTofu core team started working with the community on [a possible port of the VS Code extension for OpenTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/vscode-opentofu).

## Future plans

With provider iteration now implemented, we are turning our attention to the other [much-requested features](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1496). Most importantly, we already have a working prototype for the OCI provider registry and we are also [looking for your input on the related RFCs](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+oci+rfc). For more details on upcoming features take a look at the [1.10.0 planning milestone](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/milestone/11) on GitHub.
