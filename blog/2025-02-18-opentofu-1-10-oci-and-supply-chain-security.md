It's been about a month since our [recent 1.9 release](/blog/opentofu-1-9-0) and as promised, we’ve been hard at work implementing the top upvoted feature on our list — OCI registries. This blog post is a very early preview of our OCI plans and how you will be able to use the new functionality.

Unexpectedly, our OCI work also led us to explore enabling Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) artifacts in the provider ecosystem—a topic we’ll discuss further in this post.

## OCI: why?

Issue [308](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/308) dates back to the early days of OpenTofu. Our former tech lead, Kuba Martin—who continues to support OpenTofu from Spacelift—created a prototype that leveraged OCI registries (commonly known as Docker registries) to retrieve provider images instead of using the niche Terraform/OpenTofu Provider Registry Protocol. This approach garnered significant interest across social media.

However, other features gathered more upvotes. As such, we added [state encryption in 1.7](/blog/opentofu-1-7-0), [early evaluation in 1.8](/blog/opentofu-1-8-0) and [provider `for_each` in 1.9](/blog/opentofu-1-9-0). With OCI now the highest priority item on our agenda, we set out to answer one key question: _Why?_

While we had theories on why users might prefer OCI over existing registry protocols, opinions were split even within the core team. After developing several prototypes to assess feasibility, we turned to our community with a survey asking: Why do you want to use OCI, and what would you use it for?

Some responses aligned with our expectations, while others were surprising. In total, 103 people responded. Interest in using OCI for both providers and modules was high—90% for modules and 82% for providers. In each case, most respondents indicated a preference for a private OCI deployment, either to publish private artifacts or to mirror public ones in environments like air-gapped systems. Notably, 33% of respondents reported running air-gapped systems, and 85% expressed interest in integrating a security scanner (e.g., Trivy) with OpenTofu and OCI. Many also commented that using an existing OCI registry for OpenTofu would reduce maintenance and compliance burdens while serving as an effective caching layer to lower bandwidth usage and CI runtimes.

From the outset, we intended this project to be community-driven. Accordingly, our first priority has been to support private OCI registries—ensuring robust private publishing and mirroring use cases. Our second priority, slated for a future release, is to make OCI a first-class citizen in the provider and module ecosystem, allowing these artifacts to be published to and consumed directly from an OCI registry without involving the OpenTofu Registry. You can read the full analysis of our survey [in the OCI RFC](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2163).

## Isn't OCI a _container_ image registry?

A question that often comes up when discussing this feature is the suitability of OCI as a means to distribute artifacts that are not container images. After all, a provider or a module isn't a container image and doesn't even look like one. Fortunately, today OCI has already transcended its original purpose as a mere container image registry and, thanks to the work of the OCI maintainers, is now a general-purpose artifact storage system. Its use case as a general artifact storage is now [codified into the image spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/manifest.md#guidelines-for-artifact-usage) and tools making use of it, like [ORAS](https://oras.land) (OCI Registry As Storage), have widespread support among popular cloud and infrastructure providers. Tools like [Helm](https://helm.sh/) use ORAS as a way to store non-container artifacts and this practice is by now well established.

Tying OpenTofu into this already-existing ecosystem presented us with some fortunate opportunities. OpenTofu already has a well-established format for distributing providers and modules: the good old ZIP archive. When you run `tofu init`, OpenTofu contacts the OpenTofu registry and fetches the provider ZIP, recording its SHA256 hash in the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file to guard against tampering. As luck would have it, SHA256 hashes are what identify OCI blobs and manifests too. You can see this when running the following command:

```
$ docker pull ghcr.io/opentofu/opentofu
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from opentofu/opentofu
66a3d608f3fa: Pull complete
7c8581932a32: Pull complete
52e2b5b86328: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:319a00ffec7ffdc5bf90c8edfc9d80aa8e73b893a056e390fcdf97526b0f162c
Status: Downloaded newer image for ghcr.io/opentofu/opentofu:latest
ghcr.io/opentofu/opentofu:latest
```

Having the same hashing format means that you can simply upload the ZIP file to an OCI registry as an artifact and identify it with the same checksum. Because the checksums will be the same, a transition from the OpenTofu Registry to OCI will be seamless, the lock file will remain valid. Even better, OCI has built-in support for multi-platform artifacts, meaning that it is possible to publish multiple provider operating system / architecture combinations under one name the same way we did in the OpenTofu Registry.

For modules, the situation is even simpler as they are not published for multiple platforms. You could simply push a module artifact with a single ORAS command:

```
oras push \
    --artifact-type application/vnd.opentofu.module \
    ghcr.io/yourname/terraform-your-module \
    terraform-your-module.zip:archive/zip
```

## The tricky part: provider addresses are virtual

At first glance, this may sound too good to be true—and to some extent, it is. OpenTofu modules already incorporate scheme prefixes in their addresses, making it possible to reference a module like this:

```hcl
module "foo" {
  source = "oci://ghcr.io/yourname/terraform-your-module"
}
```

In contrast, providers do not support an `oci://` prefix. They are strictly tied to the format of `HOSTNAME/NAMESPACE/TYPE` (e.g. `registry.opentofu.org/hashicorp/aws`), where `HOSTNAME` defaults to `registry.opentofu.org` and `NAMESPACE` defaults to `hashicorp` for historic reasons.

Not all OCI registries have an addressing scheme that clearly fits OpenTofu's provider addresses. Without a scheme component, OpenTofu must determine whether the specified hostname corresponds to an OCI registry or an OpenTofu/Terraform registry.

As you can see, there is a lot remaining to be done. For now, OpenTofu will make use of its [CLI configuration](https://opentofu.org/docs/cli/config/config-file/#provider-installation). In order to use OCI for providers, you will have to create a `.tofurc` file in your home directory with a specific configuration that will tell OpenTofu which hosts are OCI registries and how to map the provider addresses to OCI addresses.

## Supporting security scanners: SBOM

In our survey 85% of respondents indicated that they would be interested in using a security scanner in conjunction with OpenTofu. The most popular security scanner, [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/), supports scanning Go binaries within container images out of the box, reporting known security vulnerabilities in them based on the dependency list automatically. Unfortunately, the same is not true for ZIP artifacts. While we could have chosen a standard container image layout to store providers, it would rob us of the ability to use the same provider hashes and break the lock file during migration. It would also add quite a bit of complexity to the implementation, so ultimately we ended up using the ZIP artifacts in an ORAS-style layout.

Not all is lost, though. The security industry has steadily been moving towards supporting Software Bill of Materials artifacts (SBOM). These SBOMs allow a software author to publish an artifact containing a list of all dependencies and their versions. Security scanners like Trivy can use these SBOMs to perform the same license and security scans they would by inspecting the binaries. Since OCI supports attaching extra files to their artifacts, security scanners can automatically pick up these artifacts and perform the security scan that way.

To address this an RFC was created to introduce SBOMs into the OpenTofu ecosystem [here](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2494). The RFC proposes that providers and modules should be able to publish SBOMs alongside their ZIP artifacts.
