This version includes provider-defined functions and significant improvements from the alpha version.

As with the [alpha version](/blog/help-us-test-opentofu-1-7-0-alpha1/), we did everything we could to test this version and would like to ask for the help of the community to help us test this version on **non-production** workloads. [Grab your copy on GitHub](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/releases/tag/v1.7.0-beta1) and let us know what you think using [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/new/choose).

:::warning

Do not test this release on a production project! It is not a stable release!

## Provider-defined functions

The new Terraform Plugin SDK added support for provider-defined functions that you can use directly in OpenTofu. This is a significant improvement over using data sources as provider-defined functions don't increase the size of your state file and require less code to write.

If you want to test provider-defined functions, you can use the [corefunc](https://library.tf/providers/northwood-labs/corefunc/latest) provider by [Ryan Parman](https://github.com/skyzyx):

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    corefunc = {
      source = "northwood-labs/corefunc"
      version = "1.4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "corefunc" {
}

output "test" {
  value = provider::corefunc::str_snake("Hello world!")
  # Prints: hello_world
}
```

## Loopable import blocks

We made several improvements to the declarative import blocks, most prominently you can now use the `for_each` instruction on the block. We have prepared a [full documentation](/docs/language/import/#importing-multiple-resources) for this feature.

In previous OpenTofu versions, you could already use the `import` block to declaratively import resources, for example:

```hcl
resource "random_id" "test_id" {
  byte_length = 8
}

import {
  to = random_id.test_id
  id = "Y2FpOGV1Mkk"
}

output "id" {
  value = random_id.test_id.b64_url
}
```

In this new version you can now also declaratively import resources in a loop: 

```hcl
variable "server_ids" {
  type = list(string)
}

resource "random_id" "test_id" {
  byte_length = 8
  count = 2
}

import {
  to = random_id.test_id[tonumber(each.key)]
  id = each.value
  for_each = {
    for idx, item in var.server_ids: idx => item
  }
}

output "id" {
  value = random_id.test_id.*.b64_url
}
```

The example above will let you specify some random IDs from a variable, and let others be automatically generated.

## State encryption

State encryption is one of the flagship features of this release. We have prepared a [full documentation](/docs/language/state/encryption/) for this feature. Since the alpha release we overhauled the migration process from unencrypted to encrypted state files and the rollback mechanism to make the syntax more explicit.

Before you test this feature, please **make a backup** of your state file. You can then add the following block to enable state encryption:

```hcl
terraform {
  encryption {
    key_provider "pbkdf2" "my_passphrase" {
      ## Enter a passphrase here:
      passphrase = ""
    }

    method "aes_gcm" "my_method" {
      keys = key_provider.pbkdf2.my_passphrase
    }

    ## Remove this after the migration:
    method "unencrypted" "migration" {
    }

    state {
      method = method.aes_gcm.my_method
      
      ## Remove the fallback block after migration:
      fallback{
        method = method.unencrypted.migration
      }
      ## Enable this after migration:
      #enforced = true
    }
  }
}
```

You can migrate back using the following syntax:

```hcl
terraform {
  encryption {
    key_provider "pbkdf2" "my_passphrase" {
      ## Enter a passphrase here:
      passphrase = ""
    }

    method "aes_gcm" "my_method" {
      keys = key_provider.pbkdf2.my_passphrase
    }

    method "unencrypted" "migration" {
    }

    state {
      method  = method.unencrypted.migration
      enforced = false
      fallback{
        method = method.aes_gcm.my_method
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you have access to an AWS, GCP account, or an OpenBao/MPL-licensed HashiCorp Vault installation, you can also [test these key providers](/docs/language/state/encryption/#key-providers).

## Removed block

The removed block lets you remove a resource from the state file but keep it on the infrastructure. We have prepared a [full documentation](/docs/language/resources/syntax/#removing-resources) for this feature. You can test it by creating a resource first:

```hcl
resource "local_file" "test" {
  content = "Hello world!"
  filename = "test.txt"
}
```

After applying, you can replace the resource with a removed block:

```hcl
removed {
  from = local_file.test
}
```

After the next apply, you will see that the `local_file.test` resource no longer exists in your state file, but the `test.txt` file should still exist on your disk. You can now remove the removed block safely.

## Built-in function changes

This release also contains several new functions and changes to existing functions:

- New function: [templatestring](/docs/language/functions/templatestring/)
- New function: [base64gunzip](/docs/language/functions/base64gunzip/)
- New function: [cidrcontains](/docs/language/functions/cidrcontains/)
- New function: [urldecode](/docs/language/functions/urldecode/)
- New function: [issensitive](/docs/language/functions/issensitive/)
- [nonsensitive](/docs/language/functions/nonsensitive/) no longer returns an error when the applied values are not sensitive.
- [templatefile](/docs/language/functions/templatefile/) now supports recursion up to a depth of 1024.

## CLI changes

There are also several changes to the CLI:

- `tofu init` now supports the `-json` flag for JSON output.
- `tofu plan` now has a `-concise` flag to shorten the plan output.
- `tofu console` now works on Solaris and AIX.
- The CLI now supports the XDG directory specification.
- Aliases for:
  - `state list` &rarr; `state ls`
  - `state mv` &rarr; `state move`
  - `state rm` &rarr; `state remove`

## Testing feature changes

- Tofu now reads the `.tfvars` file from the tests folder.
