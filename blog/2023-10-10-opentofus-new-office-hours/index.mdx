OpenTofu is introducing new office hours, open to everyone.

<!--truncate-->

These sessions will be held every two weeks over a Zoom. Expect to see developers and regular contributors, with a rotation of different contributors over time. To accommodate everyone, we’ll adjust the timings each session, catering to different time zones.

The next office hour is this **Wednesday at 10am PT**. For all future dates, subscribe to our Google calendar by [clicking this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?cid=c_3f2dd3c1fe0ef4e93ef3fc456ca2dd219a2e8fd85f6b40750af16c3df370bf93@group.calendar.google.com), or importing the following URL:
